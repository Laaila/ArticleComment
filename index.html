        How to say a beautiful ‘hello’ – inspired by philosophy from non-English
        speaking cultures
      </h1>

      <p>
        Hi. Or should that be: hello? Or: hey? Or: yo? Or: ’sup? In English,
        there is no shortage of ways to greet someone casually or informally –
        and most English speakers will use one or more of these greetings every
        day.
        <br />
        Of course, English also has a number of formal or respectful greetings,
        such as “How are you?” and the now slightly dated: “How do you do?” But
        while these may appear to be inquiries into someone’s wellbeing, they
        are normally used to demonstrate politeness in greeting rather than a
        genuine interest in and concern for others.
        <br />

        It seems that when greeting someone in English, our choice is between
        the informal and the insincere. If languages reflect the culture and
        values of their speakers, this suggests English-speaking regions value
        informality and insincerity, or, with a more positive spin, simplicity
        and politeness.
        <br />

        Outside of English, there are many greetings that provide unique
        glimpses into the cultures of their speakers, reflecting different
        traditions and ways of acknowledging, respecting and honouring others.
        <br />

        For example: the Arabic greeting “as-salāmu ‘alaykum” (peace be upon
        you) follows the instruction in the Qur’an (24.61) for Muslims to “give
        greetings of peace upon each other – a greeting from Allah, blessed and
        good”. The Sanskrit greeting “namaste” (a bow to you) is often
        accompanied by a slight bow and pressing the palms together in a sign of
        respect and deference.
        <br />

        And in cultures that prize hospitality and the importance of communal
        eating, it is common to find greetings that mean “have you eaten?”, such
        as the Mandarin “nǐ chī le ma” and the Korean “bap meogeosseoyo”“,
        though both are often considered equivalent to the English "how are
        you?” or “hello”.
